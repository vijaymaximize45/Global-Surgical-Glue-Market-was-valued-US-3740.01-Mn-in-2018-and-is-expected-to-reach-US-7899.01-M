Global Automotive NVH Materials market was valued at US$ 7.3 Bn in 2017 and is expected to reach US$ 12.8 Bn by 2026, at a CAGR of 7.27 % during the forecast period.



Increasing automotive production coupled with increasing consumer warranty claims against vehicle manufacturers for component noise vibration and harshness is the primary factor driving the growth of the market. Further, the growing demand for the customization and auto replacement parts for soundproofing is projected to increase the demand for the automotive NVH materials market over the forecast time frame. Use of substitute products to mitigate such effects are restraining the growth of the automotive NVH materials market. For instance, the installation of active noise control systems.

Rubbers segment held a major share of the automotive NVH market and is expected to remain the dominant material type during the forecast period. Rubber based materials are easily replaceable and easy to the manufacturer. Rubbers segment provide ideal noise insulation and vibration damping and have high density due to which they are widely accepted as sound absorbing the material in the automotive industry.

Passenger vehicle segment is the largest end-use segment followed by LCV and HCV. The high share of passenger vehicle is accredited to the relatively higher production output of cars among all vehicle types, globally. A fast-growing logistics industry will bolster growth in the commercial vehicles space going forward and the biggest beneficiary will be the light commercial vehicles (LCV) segment, followed by HCV.

The Asia Pacific is leading producing and consuming region in automotive. Countries such as China, India and Japan are considered as a global automotive hub with the existence of a large number of automotive and auto component manufacturers. These factors drive the demand for automotive NVH materials during the forecast period. North America followed the Asia Pacific is anticipated to hold a major share during the forecast period. Increase in preference towards hybrid cars and electric cars are the major factors which are contributed to driving the NVH materials market in North America. Europe region being third exhibits considerable growth. Middle East & Africa and Latin America are expected sluggish growth rate owing to political instability in some of the leading countries in these regions.
